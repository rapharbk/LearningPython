# LearningPython
In this repository, I will document my self-learning process of Python. I will document every single step I take and study every single day, even if it's just for 10 minutes. I believe it's important to dedicate at least a little bit of time to studying, no matter how busy I am.

If you are reading this, thank you for being here, and I hope that sharing my process will help and motivate you to study more and more.

Attention, some notes will be in Portuguese, because I'm Brazilian and it's easier for me.

Day 1 -
I started by searching on Google for a comprehensive course for beginners and ended up finding this link: https://youtu.be/rfscVS0vtbw. I watched the first few minutes to ensure the content and teaching quality, and I liked it. So, I decided to follow the step-by-step instructions.
I installed Python from the official website and now needed an IDE. In the video, the instructor recommended one called "PyCharm," but since I wasn't familiar with it, I chose VSCode. I knew I could use VSCode to create and link my repository, where I would store all the steps and use it as a backup. Connecting GitHub to VSCode wasn't easy; it gave me some strange errors, but after a few hours, I managed to resolve them. After that, I continued following the video as far as I could. After all, it's a 4-hour-long video, and I won't be able to finish it all in just one day.

Day 2 -
Today, my main focus will be on continuing to watch this video lesson.
Today i also managed to create a very basic calculator and a mini Mad Libs game. Additionally, I learned a lot about lists. I'm excited and hopeful that Day 3 will be even more enjoyable and engaging

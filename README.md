# LearningPython
In this repository, I will document my self-learning process of Python. I will document every single step I take and study every single day, even if it's just for 10 minutes. I believe it's important to dedicate at least a little bit of time to studying, no matter how busy I am.
If you are reading this, thank you for being here, and I hope that sharing my process will help and motivate you to study more and more.
Attention, some notes will be in Portuguese, because I'm Brazilian and it's easier for me.


## Day 1 - Day 7
I embarked on my Python learning journey by searching for a beginner's course online. After finding a suitable course link:(https://youtu.be/rfscVS0vtbw), I installed Python from the official website and opted to use VSCode as my integrated development environment (IDE) instead of PyCharm. I faced challenges while connecting GitHub to VSCode but managed to overcome them after a few hours of troubleshooting. I diligently followed the video lessons, knowing that completing a four-hour-long course in a single day would be unrealistic.

During Day 2, I continued watching the video lessons and even found time to create a basic calculator and a mini Mad Libs game. Exploring lists proved to be a valuable learning experience.

On Day 3, time constraints limited my studying, but I resolved to improve the organization of my project folder in the future.

Day 4 brought about a productive two-hour study session where I implemented a game called "SecretWord" and attempted to enhance it with hints.

Day 5 deepened my understanding of loops, if-else statements, and arrays. Additionally, I brainstormed creative Python projects to practice and refine my skills.

Import issues plagued Day 6, and although they remain unresolved, I remained positive and productive. I neared the end of the beginner's course, ready to transition to more intermediate and advanced material.

Day 7 marked the completion of the beginner's course, instilling a strong comprehension of Python fundamentals. I acknowledged the necessity of practical application and planned to invent my own projects. I also expressed a desire to continue learning through intermediate and advanced Python videos.

Throughout my Python learning journey. I remain eager to expand my knowledge and apply Python in practical scenarios.
